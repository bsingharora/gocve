A Parser for parsing NIST CVEs in golang

It's still very very much WIP, does some basic printing of descriptions.
To test download and unzip the feed from https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/data-feeds

## TODOs
1. Implement cpe matching
1. Implement impact based filtering
1. Implement http loading of the content and decoding the content

## NOTE
I am using this as a tool to teach me golang, feel free to criticize
the code.
