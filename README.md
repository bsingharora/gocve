A Parser for parsing NIST CVEs in golang

It's still very very much WIP, does some basic printing of descriptions.
To test download and unzip the feed from https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/data-feeds

## TODOs
1. Implement impact based filtering
2. Consider providing APIs in the form of a library for reuse
3. Move to an interface model for output
4. Extract more metadata from the JSON

## NOTE
I am using this as a tool to teach me golang, feel free to criticize
the code.
